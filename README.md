# Exploratory Data Analysis on Energy Consumption

## Data Source

The data used for this project was mostly from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) databases, namely:
- [Energy Data](https://github.com/owid/energy-data)

## Tools

The project was made using Python downloaded via Anaconda, in Jupyter Notebooks. I've also used:
- *Pandas*: For creating dataframes
- *Numpy*: For making faster calculations
- *MatPlotLib*: For ploting graphs

The presentation was made using an open source software called inkscape and assembled using microsoft powerpoint.

## Motivation

My main motivation for doing this project was finishing the [Google Data Analyst certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/49P5CVETUWFL?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=prof), which required us to do, as a final project, a complete data analysis of a subject (either one of the previously selected or one of my own choice).

I choose to do an analysis on energy consumption for two main reasons:
 1. I'm greatly interested in the subject of energy and sustainability.
 2. Much of what is talked on these subjects is in the basis of "He said, she said", so I wanted to get the data for myself and see which conclusions I would reach.
